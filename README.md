# SUCCESS PRO - Web Version

SUCCESS is a financial management software originally developed with WINDEV for Windows systems. With the rise of AI innovations and modern technological demands, the software is being revamped into a web-based version using Angular. This project aims to modernize SUCCESS, offering enhanced functionality and a more user-friendly interface.

## 1. Overview

SUCCESS PRO is transitioning to a web version, expanding its reach beyond desktop platforms to support more recent, open, and scalable web technologies. This transformation will not only make the software more versatile but also improve the overall user experience and ensure its adaptability to future needs.

## 2. Objective

The main goal is to migrate the existing functionality of SUCCESS PRO into a web application using modern technologies like Angular. The project also focuses on improving the ergonomics and usability of the software while maintaining or enhancing its core financial management capabilities.

## 3. Expected Results

The web version will integrate all the existing features of SUCCESS PRO, with functional and graphical improvements, including:

### User Management
- **User Self-Creation**: Users can create their accounts, reducing the need for administrator or supervisor intervention.
- **Email Invitations**: Administrators can invite users by entering their email and assigning specific roles. If a user doesn't have an account, an invitation will be sent to create one.
- **Role Management**: Administrators can modify user permissions or remove users from projects.
  
(Other modules and functionality improvements will be detailed in each sprint.)

## 4. Development Timeline
(To be inserted according to project milestones.)

## 5. Development Team

The project is managed by a team of three developers.

## 6. Conclusion

The web version of SUCCESS PRO represents a strategic modernization to enhance security, sustainability, and user experience. The project aims to preserve the performance of the existing application while strengthening its ergonomics and making it future-proof.
